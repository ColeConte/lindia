Description: Lindia provides a set of streamlined functions that allow
    easy generation of linear regression diagnostic plots in ggplot
    in just few commands. Graph types include residual plots, QQPlot, 
    boxcox graph, scale-location plot, cook's distance plot, and 
    residual-leverage plot. This package is meant for easy scheming of linear 
    regression diagnostics, while preserving merits of layered graphics in 
    ggplot.See the ggplot2 website for more information regarding the 
    functionality of ggplot.
